## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-munchables/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).

Within the `_farmPlots()` function, the following edge case can happen:
If the plot ID is lower than the max plot amount, the system uses the last updated plot metadata time and tracks this with a dirty boolean flag. The edge case occurs when a user hasnâ€™t farmed in a while and the landlord updates the plots multiple times (ie unlocks/locks multiple times), causing the last updated time to reflect the latest lock update rather than the first. This is a known edge case that we are comfortable with. HOWEVER, we will accept alternative solutions to mitigate this issue. Pointing it out will not result in a valid finding.

_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

# Overview

Munchables is a GameFi project with a twist.

The objective of the game is to earn as many Munch Points as possible. In crypto terms, you could call this "point farming".

Built on top of Blast, Munchables leverages the unique on-chain primitives to create a reward-filled journey. Players collect Munchables and keep them safe, fed and comfortable in their snuggery.
Once in a snuggery, a Munchable can start earning rewards for that player. A variety of factors influence the rewards earned, so players will have to be smart when choosing which Munchables to put in their snuggery and the strategies they use to play the game.

### EIP compliance checklist

N/A

# Additional context

## Main invariants

You can assume ConfigStorage is run by valid actors and that the only entity that can upgrade the contract is a valid entity.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)

The biggest concerns are people being able to unstake a different individual's Munchables or deadlocks (ie. where an individual's Munchable is stuck).

## All trusted roles in the protocol

All Admin roles are trusted. Every role in ConfigStorage is trusted.

âœ… SCOUTS: Please format the response above ðŸ‘† using the template belowðŸ‘‡

| Role          | Description     |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Owner         | Can upgrade contract |
| Landlord | Can change their own tax rate |
| Rentor | Can stake Munchable on Landlord's land to toil |
