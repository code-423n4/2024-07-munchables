just 277 nsloc?


[07/23/2024 20:27] ihtishamsudo
correct


[07/23/2024 21:23] 0xinsanity
yes, only LandManager


[07/23/2024 23:00] modey__
@0xinsanity ü´° 
Please is 0 considered a valid plotId ?


[07/23/2024 23:01] 0xinsanity
dis is a good point, it should not be


[07/23/2024 23:01] 0xinsanity
cuz otherwise everybody would have at least 1 plot id, which is not desirable


[07/23/2024 23:01] modey__
Alright ser. Thank you


[07/23/2024 23:05] .tedox
Isnt it valid? If user has only 1 plot available and someone wants to stake on that plot the id they would use is 0. Otherwise this check would fail `if (plotId >= totalPlotsAvail) revert PlotTooHighError();`. Maybe I did not understand the code or question correctly though

How do you run a specific test ?


[07/23/2024 23:55] 0xinsanity
change the glob in tests/run.ts line 9


[07/23/2024 23:57] 0xhelium
Hmmmm


[07/23/2024 23:58] 0xhelium
Say I wrote my own it() block test inside stakeMunch.test.ts file


[07/23/2024 23:58] 0xhelium
I want to run this only one


[07/23/2024 23:58] 0xhelium
What should i put in run.ts ?


[07/24/2024 00:11] 0xinsanity
oh im not sure, i only know how to specify the file itself


[07/24/2024 00:12] 0xinsanity
if you want it to just be that file you can change it to: `"**/LandManager/stakeMunch.test.ts"`


[07/24/2024 00:19] masol_66728
can you help me understand this sentence from the audit docs:
> The edge case occurs when a user hasn‚Äôt farmed in a while and the landlord updates the plots multiple times (ie unlocks/locks multiple times), causing the last updated time to reflect the latest lock update rather than the first.


[07/24/2024 00:20] masol_66728
what does it mean for the landlord to update the plots ?


[07/24/2024 00:20] masol_66728
when and how do the plots get updated ?


[07/24/2024 01:37] 0xinsanity
plots get updated if a player adds/removes more eth/usdb/blast token to their lock in the lockmanager

Landlord is a owner of plot and plot is like a piece of ground. So landlord lends his plots to toilors so that they can grow their Munchables.

Thanks brother! appreciate you

why there is an ‚Äúinitialize‚Äù function if in the constructor the ‚Äú_disableInitiators‚Äù does not allow any further initialization?


[07/24/2024 10:28] gd.eth
Started a thread.


[07/24/2024 10:32] filmptz
it is for the proxy to call to initialize their state,  the `_disableInitiators` prevents the impl contract to be initial and further reinitial.


[07/24/2024 10:48] anonimoux2k
Hi, does anyone explain about "deadlock"/"stuck" status within the context "deadlocks (ie. where an individual's Munchable is stuck)."?


[07/24/2024 10:51] granat__
so initialize how can be called?


[07/24/2024 10:59] filmptz
`delegatecall`


[07/24/2024 11:01] granat__
by the proxy? (so BaseConfigStorageUpgradable)


[07/24/2024 11:54] filmptz
yes, from my understanding is that the initialize processes during the constructor of the Proxy deployment 
```

contract ERC1967Proxy is Proxy, ERC1967Upgrade {
  // snipped
    constructor(address _logic, bytes memory _data) payable {
        assert(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT == bytes32(uint256(keccak256("eip1967.proxy.implementation")) - 1));
        _upgradeToAndCall(_logic, _data, false); // HERE
    }

```

So the contract have no code size at this state construction. so they will pass check this 

```
modifier initializer() {
// snipped

bool initialSetup = initialized == 0 && isTopLevelCall;  //> TRUE for the first execution //> False for the parent init
bool construction = initialized == 1 && address(this).code.length == 0; //> TRUE when parent init => BaseBlastManagerUpgradeable, BaseConfigStorageUpgradeable
}
```


[07/24/2024 12:02] granat__

[07/24/2024 12:03] granat__
but i do not understand why there is ‚ÄúdisableInitializers‚Äù in the constructor if the function initialize can be called

`you can start playing with the game by entering it into your Snuggery. This Snuggery can be considered a little home for your Munchables and can be customized at the start of your game`

can you give more context

if some function in LandManager.sol brakes another function in contract that is OOS is that is a valid issue

[07/27/2024 02:08] anonimoux2k
Sorry but I have to say this, all projects should have documentation ready before going into the audit process. I really have a hard time reading a contract with almost no comments explaining the functions, and as you said, no docs at all.

Yeah, it's tough to understand the code base without doc specs etc. You have to spend more time reviewing every line of code, even the whole repo.


[07/27/2024 02:17] gd.eth
There is still some documentation though, and this has helped me a lot

Tbh I think for this contest it is not entirely true because @0xinsanity is extremely responsive and helpful so it's not that hard to understand what is going on in the codebase

Yeah, I appreciate and thank @0xinsanity for his enthusiastic support, but the lack of docs and comments still makes it a bit difficult for auditors to access.

if a landlord withdraws funds so the plot id that used to be valid is no longer valid but you still have a munchable on it

where you can see this? `appearing on the certified warden profiles`


[08/14/2024 13:29] brivan
Go to your profile, you will see the logo if you have rewards (*if you can't see it on your profile, go to profile settings and toggle `Audits you've participated in`*)

Okay guys, let's create an automation script for this. C4 gaves us a lot and, it's time for us. But do not think simple, it won't just calculate the rewards of the winners. It will also create top 10 reward cards and it will generate the discord message. Then biggest part is coming, we will open a new audit contest for this code in order to be sure it's correctly implemented. Who wants to be in this project ? üëÄ

Thank you for your response! üôè


[08/20/2024 13:50] gd.eth
However, this issue would actually affect the scope of the audited contract. ü§£ 
Additionally, issue #215 involves normal user behavior that causes the protocol to produce unintended results. 
It's possible that the entry contract for user interaction is no longer within the audit scope, but there is no vulnerability in that entry contract itself. Instead, the impact occurs in the contract that is within the audit scope.


[08/20/2024 13:50] gd.eth
It would be advisable to have the sponsor or judge review this issue. At the very least, the sponsor should be made aware of the issue. ü•π
